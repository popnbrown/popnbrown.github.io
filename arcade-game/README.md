#Playing the Game

The object of the game is to avoid the bugs as long as you can while staying on the road. To move your character you can use the arrow keys. **Careful** don't go too far or you'll end up in water. The longer you stay on the road the higher your score will be!

*Note:*
* If your character gets hit by a bug or takes an unfortunate dive into water, the character will be reset.
* The score will only increase if your character is on the road, going back on the grass will stop the score.
* Below the current score, you will see a list of all the scores of your runs.
